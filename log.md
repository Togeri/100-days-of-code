# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2017 - 99 Days left


**Today's Progress**: Started the Portfolio Challenge at FreeCodeCamp. Went through it and established the section separation.

**Thoughts:** Starting a whole project from scratch is WAY more different AND difficult than just following the tutorials step by step. The bad thing of it it's that I'm writting this on day 3 as I've just discovered this GitHub repository. Just to keep track on progress, I will put two of my already finished projects because I guess I'll be finishing my Portfolio challenge tomorrow (on day 4)

**Link to work:** The first one is my [Tribute Page] (https://codepen.io/Togeri/pen/JbgxKo)

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 - 98 Days left

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on my Portfolio Challenge. Did some nice progress about the website's design.

**Thoughts**: Today was rough. I felt so dumb over the whole day because I coudln't understand anything. I though I understood the Grid System. Wrong. I started with Bootstrap Navbar thinking I could do it easily. Wrong. Spent 90% of my time trying to figure out how it works. I felt so dumb for today's 90% of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge. But the last 10% of the day I made some good progress, so I think it's just fine for today. I will put my second project I did just for fun (nothing about FreeCodeCamp Challenge, more like "I want to try and do this for fun" Challenge).

### Day 3: January 5, Thursday - 97 Days left

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished my Portfolio Challenge. I completed the Portfolio Section, the Footer, the Header and the "About Me" section. There's only the Damn Navbar left. Tomorrow I'm gonna get you baby.

**Thoughts** I still have to figure out one thing I want to do: I want the web to behave differently when using a PC or a smartphone: 
- On PC: Header logos are shown in Grey color, and when you put the mouse on it, .hoover subclass gives them their propper colors (had to look after them on several design pages, but it was worth it to make my idea come to life and see how it worked)
- On Smartphone: As there's no .hoover subclass on mobile devices, I want the responsive version of the webpage to show them colored instead of grey on the first place. Still have to figure out how.

Of course, I've been learning how to code for just 7 to 9 days (can't remember when I started FCC's route, and I had to stop for 3 days, so... a bit fuzzy to remember), so I don't intend to build next Facebook. Just step by step buddy, plenty of work to get done besides code. 
If I have to stablish a metaphor for it, it would something as <em>tutorials are "in-lab" tests where every parameter is contained and controlled. Working on a new project from scratch is... well, it is wild.</em> But I guess real-life problems are exactly that: facing the unexpected 24/7. I'm glad I've this idea hit me in the face just on a second day of practice. It's nice to get out of the comfort zone. Damn I feel lucky for having discovered FreeCodeCamp. I'm that learn-by-doing kind of person.

### Day 4 - January 6th, Friday - 96 Days Left

**Today's Progress**: I've completed my Tribute Page! I still encounter some problems with browser navigation and responsive behavior: 

First, I'm finding some troubles with the .hover function:

- On Safari and Chrome browser, I've got no problem with the .hover function that colors the icons when you pass the mouse through them, but Mozilla shows them grey always and doesn't respond to .hover function.

The other problem I've got is again with the .hover function:

- It doesn't make any sense to establish a .hover function in smartphones as small devices are touchscreens. Is there a way to establish every icon as .active so as to show them colored full time in smartphones, and maintain the .hover function in large screens? 
I would like to point out that I'm 101% new to code and my knowledge in JavaScript is zero, so... Any kind of CSS/HTML formatting? Because I don't want to Copy&Paste a code that haven't been written by me: I feel like that's not really helping to learn...

**Thoughts**: I still have to improve those things in my project, but to be honest, the feel you get from starting somethign from scratch and seen it done it's just amazing! 

I will put my doubts in FCC's forum, see if they can help me with this issue (and ask them the reason and 'whys' of their different methodologies.

### Day 5 - January 7th, Saturday - 95 Days Left

**Today's Progress**: I've found FCC to be such a nice community willing to help. [xNavid] (https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/xnavid/activity) and [belcurv] (https://forum.freecodecamp.com/users/belcurv/activity) have helped me a lot with the responsive issues. I've learned about @media feature and how to tag specific decives to behave speciffilcaly. I still encounter problems with Firefox as the -moz- feature isn't working for the icon issue. Safari and Chrome are solved and running perfectly. 

- Besides that, I've created two version of my Portfolio, one with squared thumbnails and one with rounded thumbnails for some images.
The reason to do so, is that I feel like there's more "individual (micro) visual coherence" between rounded borders and circle elements, such as the IDF Logo I've created on Photoshop or the GitHub Logo. 
On the other hand, I feel like there's no "general (macro) visual coherence" around the whole webpage, as there are squared elements and rounded elements... I have to figure something out for this too. 

**Thoughts**: I'm a bit concerned because I might be focusing too much on my Portfolio's "perfection" instead of moving foward to JavaScript. But the thing is that I've got to have this page ready in order to link it to my blog and my Linkedin to show my work online. 

However, tomorrow I should start JS learning. **I will put myself a deadline in order to start learning JS: Monday morning.** But damn, just 1 hour of code won't be enough to learn and practice, I can feel it. I don't have any free time with my Marketing degree, my Google courses, my blogging and now trying to learn code, but stil... I have to figure out where I'm going to pull some time off from.

### Day 6 - January 8th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started JavaScript. Went through 20 challenges of basic JavaScript at FCC.

**Thoughts**: Today's progress haven't been too much, I need to put more effort and time on it in order to progress properly.

### Day - 7 - Januart 9th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Following JavaScript tutorials. Went through 10 challenges as they were two bugs in the course. 

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm slowing down the process. It's a bit annoying, but the important thing is to keep on moving. It doesn't matter if it's slow but steady, as long as every day I make at least an 1 hour of code. Tomorrow I've got an exam, but I have to make some relevant progress so as to see this log and feel better than these last two days. I still have to figure out Benjamin's message to solve the cross-browser incompatibility issue that's griding my gears off. 

**Link(s) to work**: Nothing really, just 10 challenges foward than the link above
